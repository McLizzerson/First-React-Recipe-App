# recipeProject
This is my first React assignment for the Front-end development course at Winc Academy

We had to create an app that enables the user to search for recipes. 
The app is responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop. 
It has a filter and a search function to filter the existing recipes. 
It also has 2 pages, one overview of all recipes and once you click on a single recipe you're redirected to a detailed page for that recipe. 

I used Vite as a dev environment, React to create the different components on these pages and Chakra UI to style them. 

For a live version of this project look here:

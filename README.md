# recipeProject
This is my first React assignment for the Full-stack development course at Winc Academy.
The main aim of this assignment is to make a recipe app that looks good and is responsive, making use of React and Chakra UI. 
(This repository is a copy of the original one, in order to deploy the project with Netlify)

With this app the user can browse through a database of recipes. 
The app has 2 pages, one overview of all recipes and once you click on a single recipe you're redirected to a detailed page for that recipe. 
The app is responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop. And it has a filter and a search function to filter the existing recipes or search for a specific ingredient or health label. 

As it is our first project with React, Winc Academy provided us with a json file of recipe data to use as a database. 
(HTTP requests, API's are covered later on in the course)

I used Vite as a dev environment, React to create the different components on these pages and Chakra UI to style them.

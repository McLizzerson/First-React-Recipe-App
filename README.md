# recipeProject
This is my first React assignment for the Front-end development course at Winc Academy
(This repository is a copy of the original one, in order to deploy the project with Netlify)

We had to create an app that enables the user to search for recipes.
It has 2 pages, one overview of all recipes and once you click on a single recipe you're redirected to a detailed page for that recipe. 
The app is responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop. And it has a filter and a search function to filter the existing recipes. 

As it is our first project with React, Winc Academy provided us with a json file of recipe data to use as a database. 
Sending http requests is covered in a later project. 

I used Vite as a dev environment, React to create the different components on these pages and Chakra UI to style them.
